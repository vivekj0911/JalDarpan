Our solution ** combines Statistical methods with Deep Neural Networks and Recurring Neural Network to perform multilevel Anomaly Detection.

To support the Ministry of Jal Shaktiâ€™s initiative of installing Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLRs) across 14,000 locations nationwide, we have developed a comprehensive, real-time anomaly detection system.Our solution uses a 4-layered approach to ensure high accuracy and reduce false positives in detecting anomalies.

Layer 1: Z-Score Analysis  to detect immediate anomalies in recent data.

Layer 2:  VAE-LSTM (Variational Autoencoder with Long Short-Term Memory) to capture complex patterns and detect subtle anomalies.

Layer 3: LSTD-MTS (Latent State Temporal Detection for Multivariate Time Series) in order to enchance anomaly detection by considering multiple data dimensions simultaneously.

Layer 4: Environmental Verification to confirm whether detected anomalies are due to environmental conditions such as Sudden rain or tempreture variation.

 On detection of anomaly our SMS-Automation Service sends an alert SMS to the designated Personel.


We provide a platform for Issue and Resolution Monitoring, where details like Type of Issue, Date of Resolution, techician who resolved issue are Tracked.

On Daily, Weekly and Yearly basis data visualisation is provided.



4 stages- > Z-Score Analysis on recent data.
--> Variational Auto-Encoder LSTM Hybrid model to capture complex patterns in time series data and detect subtle anomalies 

--> Detecting longterm Spatio-Temporal dependance in context of multidimensional time series. 

--> Using local weather APIs checking if the anomalies are caused by variation in Environment.
